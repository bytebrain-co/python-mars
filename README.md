# python-mars
Get Images of Mars using Python.

This Python code uses NASAs API to get pictures of Mars.

To use this code, you'll need your own API key. You can get one from here: https://api.nasa.gov/

Once you have the API, you can do a lot of things like.
1. Get Information about Asteroids near Earth
2. Get images of other Exoplanets in the universe
3. View Images of the Earth taken by NASA
4. Get information about weather on different planets
